        You are an expert educational cost analyst. Analyze the following school fee information for {school_name} and extract:

        1. Year 12 annual tuition fee (if available)
        2. For each of the 18 categories below, determine the inclusion status using ONLY these four options:
           - "Included" - explicitly stated as included in tuition fees
           - "Separate Charge" - explicitly listed as additional fee
           - "Partially Included" - some elements included, others charged separately
           - "Not Known" - information not available in the provided text

        Categories to analyze:
        1. School sports: Coaching, training sessions, weekend competition fees, association levies, ground hire/transport, sports injury insurance, strength & conditioning
        2. School camps: Year-level outdoor ed, leadership & retreats, accommodation, catering, transport, activity providers
        3. Extracurriculars: Music ensembles/lessons, drama/productions, debating, STEM clubs, coding/robotics, service programs
        4. Stationery: Exercise books, art supplies, lab consumables, specialist materials (e.g., DT/wood/food tech)
        5. Books: Textbooks (print/digital), workbooks, e-books licences, library fees/photocopy levies
        6. Uniform: Academic uniform, sports kit, co-curricular uniforms, formal wear, seasonal items
        7. Exam fees: Internal exam admin, subject levies (e.g., science prac), external exam fees (e.g., HSC language providers, AMEB, music theory)
        8. Trips: Day trips and interstate/international tours not essential to curriculum (e.g., sports/music tours)
        9. Excursions: Curriculum-linked day excursions and incursions, museum/theatre entry, local transport
        10. Technology: Device program (BYOD vs school-issued), MDM/software licences, LMS/parent app, insurance/excess, tech support
        11. Pastoral & wellbeing: Counsellors/psych services access, wellbeing programs, camps/retreats linked to wellbeing
        12. Learning support: Literacy/numeracy support, adjustments, extension programs, psychometric testing contributions
        13. Careers & pathways: Work experience admin, careers testing, tertiary application support (UAC/early entry)
        14. Facilities & services: Locker, lab/arts/studio access, printing quotas, parking/bus services, building levies
        15. Insurance & risk: Student accident insurance, travel insurance for tours, instrument insurance (if school-hired)
        16. Graduation & events: Year 12 formal/valedictory, presentation days, house events, photo packs
        17. Admin & payments: Enrolment/application fee, acceptance bond, tuition instalment surcharges, late fees
        18. Other fees: Any additional mandatory fees not covered in the above categories

        CRITICAL: Only use information explicitly stated in the provided text. Do not make assumptions or estimates.

# Usage instructions
print("""
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
==================

1. Install required packages (run these if not already installed):
   !pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openai

2. Set your OpenAI API key:
   - Replace 'your-openai-api-key-here' with your actual OpenAI API key
   - You can get an API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

3. Run the analysis:
   main()

4. The script will:
   - Extract fee information from each school website
   - Use OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze and categorize the information
   - Create a comprehensive comparison dataset
   - Save results as 'sydney_school_fees_analysis.csv'

FEATURES:
- Analyzes real data from official school websites
- Uses AI to intelligently categorize fee structures
- Creates Excel-ready comparison dataset
- Follows the exact framework specified in your prompt
- Only uses information explicitly stated in official sources
